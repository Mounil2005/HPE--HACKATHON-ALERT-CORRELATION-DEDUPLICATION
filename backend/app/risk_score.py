"""Escalation Risk Score — differentiator #1.

Predicts which incident cluster is trending toward a bigger failure. This is a
deliberately explainable heuristic, not a trained model: every input can be
defended under judge questioning, and each factor maps to something an on-call
engineer already watches instinctively.

    risk = 0.4 * growth_rate + 0.35 * severity_trend + 0.25 * service_spread

Factors (each normalized to 0..1):
- growth_rate:    alerts/minute joining the cluster, capped at CAP_ALERTS_PER_MIN.
                  A cluster gaining 6 alerts/min is a fire, not a blip.
- severity_trend: mean severity of the cluster, plus a bonus when newer alerts
                  are MORE severe than earlier ones (and a penalty when it is
                  cooling off). A cascade that starts critical stays hot.
- service_spread: distinct services in the cluster / CAP_SERVICES. One service
                  = contained; five services = it's jumping the fence.
