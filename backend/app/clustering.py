"""TF-IDF embedding + time-windowed DBSCAN clustering, and root-cause pick.

Two alerts belong to the same incident when they are (a) textually related
and (b) close in time. We encode both into one distance:

    distance = cosine_distance(tfidf_vectors) + TIME_PENALTY beyond TIME_SCALE

so DBSCAN naturally refuses to merge similar-looking alerts that fired hours
apart. Noise alerts land in DBSCAN's label -1 bucket and stay uncorrelated —
exactly the behavior we want for routine background alerts.

Uses scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorizer rather than a transformer sentence
embedding model — real, explainable, and light enough to run on a
memory-constrained host (no torch/transformers dependency at all). The
tradeoff, stated plainly: TF-IDF catches shared vocabulary, not paraphrase —
two alerts describing the same failure in different words won't be pulled
together the way a semantic embedding might. Given this project's alerts are
machine-generated from a fixed set of message templates (real log lines or
templated synthetic messages), shared vocabulary is already a strong, honest
signal for "these describe the same thing."

Root-cause pick: the earliest alert in the cluster (failures propagate forward
in time), broken toward higher severity when several fire in the same minute.
